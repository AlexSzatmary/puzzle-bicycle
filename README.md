Puzzle Bicycle
==============

Puzzle Bicycle is an application to help people have fun making and solving logic
puzzles like Akari, Heyawake, and Suraromu, by using special solvers that use human
strategies.

For creators, Puzzle Bicycle lets you,
* set and solve your puzzle simultaneously
* know when your puzzle becomes impossible due to an error
* confirm that your puzzle has the difficulty level you intend (TODO)

For players, Puzzle Bicycle lets you,
* automate moves that you find easy
* reset your puzzle to before your first mistake
* ask for hints that teach you how to solve like experts (TODO)

Puzzle Bicycle will not generate random puzzles.

Akari is supported. I plan to do Heyawake and Suraromu next.

Inspiration
-----------

* [Good Sudoku](https://www.playgoodsudoku.com/) uses a catalog of techniques that allow
  puzzles to be graded and contextual hints to be offered.
* [This article](https://web.archive.org/web/20200117074130/https://www.nikoli.co.jp/en/misc/20060703the_japan_time.html) on Nikoli.
* Steve Jobs said that a computer is like
  ["a bicycle for our minds"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ob_GX50Za6c). Puzzle Bicycle is supposed to help you think, not think for you.
